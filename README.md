# vpos-revisit
This code accompanies the following paper:
- Snakes on a Plane: do Milky Way stellar streams and globular clusters align in a Vast Polar Structure? (https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11564)

We re-visit the association of Milky Way stellar streams and globular clusters with the Vast Polar Structure (https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5176) in light of recent discoveries and measurements.

Please [e-mail Alex Riley](alexriley@tamu.edu) with any questions or comments. The repo will likely receive a make-over upon acceptance.

### conda environment
The environment to run this code can be installed using `conda`. There are two different environment files here:
- `conda-env.yml`: includes the necessary packages to run all the analysis
- `conda-env-explicit.yml`: in the event that the above file doesn't work, I created this file using `conda env export` which _had better work_
